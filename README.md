# calico

This repository will host code for calibrating asynchronous camera networks, or multicamera systems.  

This work is described in a paper: "Calibration of Asynchronous Camera Networks: CALICO"

The current version is on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06811), and will be updated with this code is live.  

To be notified when the code is updated here, watch the repository and you'll get a message. At that point you can unwatch and clone/fork/star, etc.
